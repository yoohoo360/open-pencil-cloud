# Repo tooling, CI, and releases

Private tooling lives under `tools/<role>/<domain>/{src,tests}`; Steiger enforces the layout and kebab-case domain names. Every tool is a workspace named `@open-pencil/<domain>-tools`, listed literally in the root `workspaces` (the manifest schema rejects globs on purpose), so it can declare dependencies and run through `bun --filter`. `bun run check:tools` type-checks every tool through `tools/tsconfig.json`; `bun run test:tools` runs every tool with a `test` script. A tool imports its own files through its package.json `imports` alias (`#ci/*`, `#release/*`), other tools through their package name, and the docs site config through the shared `#docs-config/*` path.

- Nothing under `generate/` or `release/` runs from `bun run check` except through a check entrypoint; `generate/authoring-reference` keeps its `check.ts` beside `generate.ts` until it splits.
- Resolve the workspace with `resolveWorkspaceRoot` from `@open-pencil/package-artifacts-tools`, not parent-directory traversal. Keep sibling imports relative.
- `checks/test-homes` owns `engine-baseline.txt` and `check:test-homes`; `dev/unit-tests` owns the shard map and runner (`tests/AGENTS.md`).
- No `scripts/` entrypoints: root `package.json` scripts call tool files directly.

## CI

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `heavy-tests.yml` define validation gates. PR CI always classifies changed paths through `tools/ci/policy/src/policy.ts`: root docs, package READMEs, every `AGENTS.md`, `packages/docs` Markdown and assets, and skill Markdown are docs-only; runtime prompt Markdown, executable examples, configuration, and unknown paths require code validation.
- Docs-only changes run documentation integrity and the docs build; everything else runs the full suites. The aggregate `CI result` gate requires successful classification and every applicable job; failures, cancellations, and unexpected skips cannot pass. Do not restore workflow-level path filtering on required CI.
- `commitlint.config.ts` enforces commit structure in the **Commit messages** job; the separate **PR title** workflow validates titles. Preserve the `Release vX.Y.Z` exception and product casing when changing rules; the known AI co-author check does not rewrite base history. Gate policy lives in `tools/ci/policy/src/policy.ts`.
- `tools/ci/policy` runs right after Bun is set up, before any install, so it imports only Node built-ins; `oxlint.json` switches `open-pencil/prefer-es-toolkit` off there. Other CI tools install their workspace first, as `pr-review-guidance.yml` does through `.github/actions/setup-bun`.
- Required checks must also run on `merge_group`, the merge queue's event; read base and head from `merge_group.base_sha`/`head_sha` there (`ci.yml`, `pr-title.yml`).
- A passing pull request run records the tree it tested as the `CI verified tree` status on the PR head; a merge queue commit with that exact tree is classified `verified` and runs only the always-on checks. Any other tree, including a group with other PRs ahead, gets the full run (`tools/ci/policy/src/verified-tree/`).
- App and docs production workflows run on `v*` tags or `workflow_dispatch`, not ordinary `master` pushes. `build.yml` checks the tooling out under `.pipeline/` and runs `tools/release/release-packages` from there.

## Releases

- Update versions in the root and publishable package manifests plus `desktop/tauri.conf.json` and `desktop/Cargo.toml`; move `Unreleased` into `## x.y.z — YYYY-MM-DD`; commit `Release vX.Y.Z`; tag and push `vX.Y.Z`.
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` is the source of truth: `v*` tags (or dispatches for an immutable stable tag) build shared frontend/package outputs once, build signed desktop artifacts in parallel, verify and attest one complete same-run artifact set, publish npm packages, and replace the draft release assets using the exact changelog section. Policy, provenance, and recovery: `tools/release/release-packages/README.md`.
- Public workspace packages are discovered by the package-artifacts catalog. Bun source exports require the complete `src` directory in package contents; Node exports use `dist`. Release preparation must preserve resolution maps. Prepared publish directories receive the root `LICENSE` when a package has none of its own, and every package needs a `README.md` because npm renders it. Publishing uses prepared npm tarballs verified through the shared Node/Bun consumer checks; never publish package directories manually. `test:packages` first runs the packaging guards in `tools/checks/package-quality/src/smoke/guards.ts`: fixture manifests packed with the real `npm pack` that must trip the tarball inspector and the Node/Bun consumer checks before those checks vouch for real packages.
- Ensure Tauri and Apple signing/notarization secrets are configured. Verify the draft title, body, and artifacts, then publish. Release titles are exactly the tag (`vX.Y.Z`) without a product-name prefix.
- Homebrew's `openpencil` cask is managed upstream: BrewTestBot proposes bumps and Homebrew merges them. Check the upstream cask PR after publication; do not push to the archived custom tap or add bump automation. Users install the app with `brew install --cask openpencil` and the CLI through npm or Bun.

## Demo document

The `/demo` document is built from `tools/generate/demo/src/document/` into the ignored `public/demo.fig`, and the app opens it like any `.fig` file; it is never generated in the browser. `ensureDemoDocument` runs from `vite.config.ts`, rebuilds only when its inputs' fingerprint changes, and runs the build in Bun; `bun run generate:demo` forces it. A section that needs something new from the engine adds that package's `src` to the fingerprint in `tools/generate/demo/src/ensure.ts`.

## Brand assets

Canonical artwork lives in `assets/brand/` (main mark and optical micro master; see its README). `tools/generate/brand/` derives web, docs, and native icons with RealFaviconGenerator and Tauri; generated assets are ignored, not committed. Vite and VitePress configs prepare their own targets, and Tauri dev/build hooks prepare native icons.
