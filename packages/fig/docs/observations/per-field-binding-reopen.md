# Per-field binding inheritance

The inherited-expression fixture receives a placed left-padding binding to direct token 12
and a definition-level right-padding binding to inherited token 20. After synchronization,
left padding is 6 and right padding 5; outer width 36 and nested width 16.

Export reopened in Figma retains those values. Changing the inherited token 20→40 changes
right padding 5→10 and outer width 36→41, while explicitly bound left padding stays 6. The token
is restored to 20. `per-field-binding-reopen.json` records both observations.

SceneGraph synchronization merges bindings and conversion factors per field. Whole-map
legacy protection remains effective when declared by an owner without per-field claims.
Another owner's per-field claims must not weaken that protection; synthetic regression tests
cover both outer-owner and self-owner combinations. The mixed legacy test is a SceneGraph
provenance contract, not a claim that Figma writes the same internal protection representation.

No pixel oracle is provided for this case. Explicit unbinding and later inheritance of another
field are covered locally, not by this external reopen capture.
