## Distinct contracts

| Check | Proves | Does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Encoded-field assertions | Requested records were emitted | Figma interprets them correctly |
| OpenPencil round trip | Reader and writer agree on tested behavior | Independent format correctness |
| Figma property comparison | Tested effective properties match | Actual pixels or untested metadata |
| Direct render comparison | New-reader graph renders similarly | Export/reopen fidelity |
| Figma reopen and interaction | External interpretation and tested editing work | All documents/features work |

**Required invariant:** Figma is the compatibility oracle. Round-trip stability through our own
reader proves only that we are self-consistent.

## Comparison discipline

- Verify the active Figma file key and target before capture.
- Use world-space coordinates; group-relative conventions can differ between APIs.
- Capture complete trees, including hidden descendants. Report hidden geometry separately.
- Match bounds, scale, fonts, and color space before measuring pixels.
- Use native resolution or increased export scale; do not downsample away differences.
- Do not judge rendering by exporting and reimporting through our own reader.
- Separate font availability from exact binary identity.
- Compare edited output to the same edit in original Figma, not an unchanged original.
- After mutation, allow dependent state to settle before reading the result.
- Inspect images as well as numbers. Small aggregate differences can hide wrong icons.

Use temporary clones for destructive oracle edits and verify cleanup. Record stable fixture
provenance next to the fixture, not transient cloud-file IDs in architecture documents.

## Maintained property comparison

Run from the repository root, with the matching Figma document open:

```sh
bun open-pencil-visual-oracles compare interpreted-document \
  --file tests/fixtures/gold-preview.fig --node 1:3461 \
  --figma-key NmoHzskYNiSKOaRX14bMdw --output /tmp/gold-oracle
```

This writes source/actual captures, differences, and grouped diagnostics. It checks selected
properties, not pixels. `--allow-partial-assignments` is diagnostic-only: skipped assignments
are recorded and cause a nonzero exit. It does not turn partial interpretation into success.

The same command is the reopen check for an export: import the exported archive into Figma
(the desktop app has no scriptable import; drag the file onto Drafts), pass that archive as
`--file` and the imported file's key, and the comparison reads Figma's interpretation of the
export against the reader's. Captures target the active document, so bring the imported
file's tab to the front first:

```sh
bun open-pencil-visual-oracles activate-tab --title gold-preview-edited
```

Property and structural differences are export defects. Geometry differences on hug and fill
layouts are expected: the reader applies saved derived geometry without a layout pass, while
Figma recomputes layout with its own text metrics. See [the reopen log](./observations/reader-reopen.md) for
a recorded run.

## Gates and regression placement

Use package tests for interpretation/export contracts, engine tests for shared editing/session
behavior, and committed Playwright snapshots for pixel-affecting renderer changes. Update a
snapshot only with an explained change and rerun without snapshot updates. Isolate both the
application server and MCP endpoint; reusing another worktree's server invalidates attribution.

```sh
bun run check
bun test packages/fig/tests tests/engine/io/fig/session
```

The complete repository test requirements remain in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md).

**Known limitation:** a single automated workflow for full edited/unedited Figma visual
round trips is not yet complete. Corpus acceptance must cover Gold, shadcn, Material 3, and
nuxtui, with strictness, performance, and page-loading equivalence tracked separately. Counts
and timings from individual runs belong in result artifacts or the integration PR.

## Render check

`visual-oracles interpret-instance` renders an interpreted instance through Skia and, with
`--figma-key`, exports the same node from the open Figma document for comparison:

```sh
bun open-pencil-visual-oracles interpret-instance \
  --file tests/fixtures/gold-preview.fig --node 1:3503 \
  --scale 2 --output /tmp/gold-input-comparison
```

It verifies the active file key and calls `exportAsync` with an explicit scale rather than
relying on saved export settings. Outputs are `interpreted.png`, `report.json` with font
status, unresolved paths and node bounds, and with a key `figma.png` and `figma-bounds.json`.

`visual-oracles compare interpreted-document` does the same for a whole archive against the
document opened in Figma, reporting property and geometry differences per node.
