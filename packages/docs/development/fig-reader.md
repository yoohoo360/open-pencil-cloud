# .fig Reader Architecture

The reader interprets Figma source records into independently editable scene occurrences.
One reader serves the application, CLI, MCP, and worker paths; the earlier importer and its
repair pipeline are gone.

::: warning Implementation status
The reader is the only import path: synchronous parsing, the document worker, page population,
recovery, export, and clipboard paste all use it, and the previous importer is removed.
Corpus-wide fidelity (export still reassigns node identities and drops some raw text metadata)
and performance acceptance remain unfinished. The diagram describes responsibilities, not a
claim of complete Figma parity.

## Key distinctions

- A **source record** identifies an archive node; an **occurrence** identifies one use of it.
- An **owner** establishes the component scope for an override **claim**.
- An effective value is not enough to determine whether it is inherited or overridden.
- Saved appearance, editable layout, and exported-file fidelity are separate contracts.

```text
                         Inherited default       Explicit equal value
Initial text             "Badge"                 "Badge"
Component changes        "Updated"               "Updated"
Instance result          "Updated"               "Badge"
```

## Package documentation

The canonical implementation documentation lives alongside the package in
[`packages/fig/docs`](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/tree/master/packages/fig/docs).
This page is the development-site entry point, not a second copy of those contracts.

Read in order:

1. [Architecture and ownership](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/blob/master/packages/fig/docs/architecture.md)
2. [Source model and identities](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/blob/master/packages/fig/docs/source-model.md)
3. [Instance evaluation and precedence](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/blob/master/packages/fig/docs/instance-evaluation.md)
4. [SceneGraph materialization](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/blob/master/packages/fig/docs/materialization.md)
5. [Document sessions, rollback, and recovery](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/blob/master/packages/fig/docs/document-sessions.md)
6. [Export contracts](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/blob/master/packages/fig/docs/export.md)
7. [Validation and oracle methodology](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil/blob/master/packages/fig/docs/validation.md)

See also [system architecture](./architecture), [testing](./testing), and the
[development roadmap](./roadmap). Fixture provenance belongs next to fixtures; individual
benchmark runs and temporary oracle results do not belong in architecture documentation.
